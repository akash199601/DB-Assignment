# DB-Assignment

1. Explain the relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities from the above diagram.
   #Answer- there is a relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities. In a typical database structure, this relationship would likely be implemented as a foreign key relationship.

Here's how the relationship would work:

Product Entity: This entity represents individual products. It likely contains attributes such as product ID, name, price, description, etc.

Product_Category Entity: This entity represents different categories or types of products. It likely contains attributes such as category ID, name, description, etc.

The relationship between these two entities is established through a foreign key in the "Product" entity. This foreign key, often named something like category_id, stores the ID of the category to which the product belongs.


2. How could you ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it?
   #Answer-  The "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it, you can use a foreign key constraint. This constraint will enforce referential integrity between the "Product" table and the "Product_Category" table, ensuring that every value in the category_id column of the "Product" table corresponds to a valid category ID in the "Product_Category" table.

In most relational database management systems (RDBMS) like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite, you can define a foreign key constraint when creating the "Product" table. Here's an example of how you can create the "Product" table with a foreign key constraint:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE Product (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    description TEXT,
    category_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (category_id) REFERENCES Product_Category(id)
);
In this SQL statement:

id is the primary key of the "Product" table.
name, price, description are attributes of the product.
category_id is the foreign key that references the id column in the "Product_Category" table.
The FOREIGN KEY constraint ensures that the values in the category_id column of the "Product" table must exist in the id column of the "Product_Category" table.
